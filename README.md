## Verifying our edits Script
The script helps a user to import two OSM.PBF files to postgreSQL and calculates the differences between them. It divides these differences into two categories:
* Deleted map features
* Modified map features

The output files are in ESRI shapefile format or geoJSON.

## Dependecies :
* Unix based OS
* osmosis
* postgreSQL
* postGIS
* pgsql2shp
* ogr2ogr


## How to run it 
Download two OSM.PBF files from a reliable source - we used [Geofabrik extracts](https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/) because of easy implementation of history PBFs extracts. 
Proceed by running the main shell in your terminal and follow the instructions.  

Just run  ``` sh main.sh ```
